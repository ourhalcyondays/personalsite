Every moment in your life has equal value and recognizing the value in every moment is a **life skill**. It's easy to see some parts of life as annoying or tedious; repetitive tasks, hard labour, difficult people. But reframing these moments so that you can extract a lesson will make life better. Repetitive tasks teach patience. Hard labour builds the body. Difficult people are opportunities to practice compassion and kindness. 

Every moment can be appreciated in at least 2 ways:
1. To practice responding gracefully and skillfully to what's happening.
2. To appreciate being alive.

Another way to see value in everyday moments is to remember that everything is connected. This means that small things are connected to the bigger picture. Learning or dealing with small things adds up to bigger life lessons.

I have a tendency to plan plan and plan, to organize my days, weeks, and months so that the maximum *value* can fit into the time that I have. I like certainty and mapping probabilities and contingencies, but it means I forget to pay attention to the reality around me, sometimes. This way to live is harder; I seldom appreciate the moment.[^1]
