## üìö I. Introduction

I have proven what Pok√©mon nerds have suspected all along:

**Not all Pok√©mon are created equal.** But exactly how unequal are things in the Pok√©mon world?

To find out, I compared the three most basic indicators of a Pok√©mon's strength; attack power, defensive power, and HP (health points). Taking data from [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/pokemon), I broke down Pok√©mon by their primary types (water, fire, grass and electric). Then, it was time to plot.


{{< figure src="Pokedata Process.png" caption="Plots were created in R using the base symbols() function (Steps 1-3). After much fiddling, I moved the plot to Photoshop for some extra visual power (Steps 4-6)." >}}

## üìä II. Pok√©data Plotting & Insights

I decided to make **bubble plots** to compare Pok√©mon stats. Bubble plots are scatterplots on steroids. They are interesting because they easily convey information on three dimensions. Besides the normal x-axis and y-axis dimensions, they can also represent data through the size of the point, or *bubble*.

In the case of Pok√©mon data, I thought it would be interesting to see whether there was a correlation between attack and defense stats, and to see how HP factored into the equation. I predicted that there would be a **positive correlation**‚Äîthat is, higher attack stats would predict higher defense stats. A positive correlation would suggest that some Pok√©mon were created to be overall stronger than other Pok√©mon.

Furthermore, I decided to split Pok√©mon by their primary type to see whether trends might be different across different types. (And alright, plotting all 898 Pok√©mon that exist in the Pok√©dex would've been a bit too much, even by my nerdy standards.)

**Here are the results of my plots:**

So were there any trends? Is there a terrible inequality to be found in the Pok√©mon world? Let's take a closer look, shall we?



#### üí¶ Water Pok√©mon Insights

{{< figure src="WaterPokemonBubblePlot2.png" caption="" >}}

- Water Pok√©mon seem to follow a fairly strong positive correlation between attack and defense stats. Unsurprsingly, Pok√©mon like **Gyrado**s and **Swampert** who are known to be powerful attackers, are also strong defenders.
- A notable outlier is **Pyukumuku**, a newly introduced Pok√©mon from Generation 7 that has average attack stats, but ranks in the top percent of defensive Pok√©mon! What a curious fellow.
- In terms of HP, it doesn't come as a surprise that **Wailord** has the biggest bubble. At 14.5m tall, it's the largest Pok√©mon found so far in the Pok√©mon world, so it makes sense that it has the resources to withstand damage.
- **Magikarp** is another Pok√©mon to note. Although beloved by some, Magikarp is one of the most ridiculed Pok√©mon not only for it's dopey expression, but also because this Pok√©mon is laughably weak (anyone who plays Pok√©mon interally groans when they encounter a Magikarp...they're not even worth battling.) However, it looks like Magikarp is not really the weakest Pok√©mon around and doesn't deserve the disrespect. As the name suggests, **Feebas** is the feeblest Pok√©mon of 'em all, having both defensive and attack stats of less than 20!

## üíª III. Pok√© R Code 

Interested in viewing the code? Check out a sample of it here.



```
# Water type Pokemon Bubble Chart -------------------------------
png("WaterPokemonBubblePlot2.png", width = 10, height = 7, units = 'in', res = 300)
radius <- sqrt( waterpokemon$hp/ pi )

# by default, my HP data would be the radius of the bubble,
# but this would skew the proportions of the bubble. So I changed
# the bubble to show HP as an area instead of a radius.

# The bubbleplot
symbols(waterpokemon$attack, waterpokemon$defense,
        circles = radius, inches = 0.4, fg = "#ffffff00", 
        bg = "#8fd4d740", main = "",
        cex.main = 2.5,
        ylab = "",
        xlab = "",
        col.lab = "#297b90",
        col.axis = "#297b90",
        col.main = "#297b90",
        ylim=c(7,150),
        xlim=c(5,160),
        yaxs="i",
        xaxs="i",
        axes = FALSE,
        family = '',
        )
box(bty="l", col= "#297b90")
axis(2, col.ticks= "#297b90", col= "#297b90", col.axis = "#297b90",
     family ="Bebas")
axis(1, col.ticks= "#297b90", col= "#297b90", col.axis = "#297b90",
     family ="Bebas")

showtext_begin()
text(waterpokemon$attack, waterpokemon$defense, waterpokemon$name,
     col= "#297b90", cex=2, family ="tw", font = 2)
showtext_end()
dev.off()
```

To get custom fonts "Bebas" and "Titillium Web" into R, I used the {showtext} & {extrafont} packages.

```
# Import custom fonts --------------------------
library("extrafont")
font.import()
loadfonts()
fonts() #view available fonts
library(showtext)
font.add("tw", "Titillium Web.ttf")
font.add.google("Titillium Web", "tw")
```

## üí≠ IV. Closing Thoughts

The goals of this project were to learn how to create bubble plots in R using base functions and to dip my toes into data visualization!

One limitation of this small project was that 

That said, the goals of this project were to learn how to create bubble plots in R using base functions and to dip my toes into data visualization while having some fun! Indeed, I learned a lot about using the R base functions to plot. Next, I think I will explore more advanced data visualization using packages like ggplot2 to have finer control over the visual components and geoms of the plot.
