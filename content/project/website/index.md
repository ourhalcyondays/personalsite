## ABOUT:

I wanted to do 3 things during the summer of 2021: create a personal site, learn R, and begin a blog. This project hit three birds with one stone! Making a **[personal website](https://jessicaqiu.me/)** was a little daunting because of one major problem: I could not code. However, around this time I began learning R for statistics, and in a fit of desperation and curiosity, I googled whether the R could create websites. And lo and behold, the answer to all my problems: the **[R{blogdown}](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown)** package! Its blog widget even tied in perfectly with another one of my summer goals: starting a blog.

- **I Learned How To**: use the R package {blogdown} for creating & editing websites, the basics of Git and Github, and basic CSS.
- **Next I Want To**: maintain this site as my semi-professional online presence, and try other cool R packages to make interesting things (like **[{shiny}](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)** for making apps).
