## ABOUT:

Making a **[personal website](https://jessicaqiu.me/)** had been a long-time goal, but there was one major problem: I could not code. This in and of itself wasn't a deal breaker. I knew coding would be a useful skill, so I had planned to learn enough HTML and CSS to get a decent website going. However, around this time I began learning R for statistics, and learning multiple coding languages with wildly different syntaxes felt daunting. In a fit of desperation, I googled whether the R could create websites. And lo and behold, the answer to all my problems: the **[R{blogdown}](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown)** package! It's blog widget even tied in perfectly with another one of my summer goals: writing more by starting a blog.

- **I Learned How To**: use R{blogdown} for creating & editing websites, the basics of Git and Github, and basic CSS.
- **Next I Want To**: keep this personal site updated to maintain a semi-professional online presence.
