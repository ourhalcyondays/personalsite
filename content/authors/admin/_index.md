I'm a third year student studying Psychology, Neuroscience & Behaviour at McMaster University. I am passionate about making stuff and learning new skills. Currently, I'm focused on further improving my research skillsâ€”I am especially drawn to research that has implications for improving people's lives and the earth we share.

When I'm not busy hustling as a student, you can find me tinkering away on R, Blender, and Photoshop CC. Did I mention I like making stuff?
