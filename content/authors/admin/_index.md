I’m a freshly minted MScOT graduate on a mission to help brains, bodies, and the world around them work a little better together. I’m currently seeking work opportunities in **neurorehabilitation**, **acute care**, or **pediatrics**.

I am passionate about developing my research skills and **bridging evidence and practice**—I am especially drawn to research that has implications for improving people’s lives and the earth we share. Currently, I am a Research Assistant at [VisAge Lab](https://www.baycrest.org/about-us-rri), where I contribute to projects investigating EEG biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease. In my free time, you can find me tinkering away on R, Photoshop CC, or Blender.
